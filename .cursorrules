# Chrome Extension Version Management

Before every commit, ask the user about version updates:

1. Ask: "Would you like to update the Chrome Extension version number?"
2. If yes, ask: "Is this a **major**, **minor**, or **patch** version change?"
3. Update the version in `manifest.json` following Semantic Versioning (semver):
   - **Major** (X.0.0): Breaking changes or significant new functionality
   - **Minor** (x.Y.0): New features that are backward-compatible
   - **Patch** (x.y.Z): Bug fixes and minor improvements
4. Include the version bump in the commit

Example flow:
- Current version: `0.1.0`
- User selects "patch" → New version: `0.1.1`
- User selects "minor" → New version: `0.2.0`
- User selects "major" → New version: `1.0.0`

# Git Commit Message Rules

Always generate Git commit messages that include:

- A concise subject line following Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat(scope): brief description`).

- A detailed body explaining:
  - **What** changes were made
  - **Where** those changes can be seen by users (if at all)
  - **Why** they were made
  - **How** they address the problem or add the feature

- Use bullet points or numbered lists within the body for clarity when describing multiple changes.

- Mention any related issues or tasks in the footer (e.g., `Fixes #123`, `Refs #456`).

- Ensure the message is comprehensive and provides sufficient context for future reference.
