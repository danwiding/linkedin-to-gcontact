# Git Commit Message Rules

Always generate Git commit messages that include:

- A concise subject line following Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat(scope): brief description`).

- A detailed body explaining:
  - **What** changes were made
  - **Where** those changes can be seen by users (if at all)
  - **Why** they were made
  - **How** they address the problem or add the feature

- Use bullet points or numbered lists within the body for clarity when describing multiple changes.

- Mention any related issues or tasks in the footer (e.g., `Fixes #123`, `Refs #456`).

- Ensure the message is comprehensive and provides sufficient context for future reference.

## Example Commit Message Format

- Success redirects to the main contacts view

Why:
- Users need to authenticate to access their Google Contacts
- Required for the LinkedIn-to-Google contact linking feature

How:
- Uses Chrome Identity API for OAuth2 flow
- Stores refresh token securely in chrome.storage.local
- Validates session on each side panel open
